# PSSaturday Karlsruhe Challenge

## Code Golf: Fear of the 13th

### Preamble

Al Fredo Mancy is a superstitious man who strongly believes in avoiding certain dates. He refuses to work on any Friday the 13th, fearing bad luck. However, heâ€™s particularly concerned about the year 2666, which he believes might be the end of the world. To ensure he doesn't end up working on a Friday the 13th in that ominous year, Al Fredo Mancy needs your help to identify all such dates in 2666 so he can plan his paid time off.

### Task

Your challenge is to write the shortest possible PowerShell script that identifies all the Fridays that fall on the 13th in the year 2666. The script should be efficient and concise, limited to the year 2666, and capable of being run on any day without requiring modifications. Al Fredo Mancy also only wants to see the output as short date string, so please make sure the output looks something like this:

```PowerShell
13.12.2666
# or
12/13/2666
```

### Submit

Submit your solutions to psugffm@gmail.com

### Notes

The output has to be "calculated" with PowerShell, so basically outputting the whole days is not a solution for this challenge.

The code will be run on a windows computer!

### Final Words

Happy golfing!
